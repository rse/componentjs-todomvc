# ComponentJS TodoMVC Example

> ComponentJS is a stand-alone MPL-licensed Open Source library for JavaScript, providing a powerful Component System for hierarchically structuring the User-Interface (UI) dialogs of complex HTML5-based Rich Clients (aka Single-Page-Apps) â€” under maximum applied Separation of Concerns (SoC) architecture principle, through optional Model, View and Controller component roles, with sophisticated hierarchical Event, Service, Hook, Model, Socket and Property mechanisms, and fully independent and agnostic of the particular UI widget toolkit.

## Running ComponentJS TodoMVC Example

First, you have to install all third-party libraries through Twitter Bower:

    $ bower install

Then access the `index.html` file through a HTTP[S] URL (because URLs
based on the `file` scheme will not work due to browser security
constraints on the used AJAX operations).
